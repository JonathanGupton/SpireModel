# Python Docstring Format Rule
Rule:
All Python docstrings must use the Numpydoc format, including the following sections as appropriate:

A concise summary line describing the function/class/module.

Parameters section, listing each parameter, its type, and a short description.

Returns section, describing the return value(s) and their types.

Provide example tests in the docstring when possible.

Example:

```python
def tokenize_event_relic(relic: str) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    """
    Tokenizes a single relic obtained from an event.

    Parameters
    ----------
    relic : str
        Name of the relic obtained.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[str, ...]
        Tuple of tokens, where the first token is "ACQUIRE" and the second token
        is the relic name.
    """
```
Enforcement:
All new and updated docstrings must follow this format. Docstrings not matching this structure should be updated to comply.
